## [Google Closure Tools: Building Resume Instant Search](/talks/google-closure-tools-resume-instant/slides/)

*These slides work best in Google Chrome*

This talk will start by going over the components of the Google
Closure Tools and will cover the templates, which are usable on both
the client and server, the library, which comes with a dependency
management system and a large set of utilities, and the compiler,
which performs advanced optimizations to speed up your JavaScript and
reduce the size of the final application. It then goes into detail on how Indeed has leveraged those tools to build resume instant search, covering using the closure tools in development, discussing the architecture that drives the product, and the advantages gained by using the closure tools.

*August 21st, 2012* - [Austin JavaScript](http://austinjavascript.com/august-2012-austin-javascript-meetup-details-announced/)
