## [Building Indeed Resume Search](/talks/building-indeed-resume-search)

I dive into the architecture of Indeedâ€™s Resume Instant Search and our use of the Google Closure tools. I explain how we write maintainable, efficient JavaScript components for Resume Instant Search and other Indeed products. I discuss how we create templates that run on both client and server, providing fast initial page load time and search engine-friendly pages with the responsiveness of client-side rendering.

## [Google Closure Tools: Building Resume Instant Search](/talks/google-closure-tools-resume-instant/slides/)

This talk will start by going over the components of the Google
Closure Tools and will cover the templates, which are usable on both
the client and server, the library, which comes with a dependency
management system and a large set of utilities, and the compiler,
which performs advanced optimizations to speed up your JavaScript and
reduce the size of the final application. It then goes into detail on how Indeed has leveraged those tools to build resume instant search, covering using the closure tools in development, discussing the architecture that drives the product, and the advantages gained by using the closure tools.
